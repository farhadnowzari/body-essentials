# Vitamins
Why Vitamins are important and vital for the body?
* Boosting the immune system.

## Fat soluble vitamins
There are four Fat soluble Vitmains that we should consider in our diets. These Vitamins are much better absorbed in our bloodstream when we eat them with fat.

This vitamin is important for `Normal Vision`, `Immune system` and `Reproduction`. This Vitamin also helps the `Heart`, `Lungs`, `Kidneys` and other organs to work properly.

**TWO Types** of Vitamin A:
1. Can be found in `Meat`, `Poultry`, `Fish` and `Dairy` products.
2. Provitamin A (Body will produce Vitamin A from this type) is available in `Fruits`, `Vegetables` and other plant-based products.

**Ok, So how much do we need daily?**
The amount to consume is dependant on our `age` and our `sex`. The average of daily use is brought to the following table.

**Note #2:**  This table is just the result of a study of studies. If you believe you or anyone who you are reading this for, have deficiency of Vitamin A it is better to visit a `Nutritionist`.
